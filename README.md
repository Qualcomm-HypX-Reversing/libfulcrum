# I AM THE ORIGINAL FULCRUM. FULCRUM COME IN. YUPPPP YODIE GANG

This is a library used to communicate with fulcrum (Arb read, write, execute, and symbolilifcation) in the kernel.

This library will take you straight to yodie land baby


## How to go to yodie land

To go straight to yodie land, you gotta hit a blinker. To hit a blinker you hit the pen (Compile the kernel patch in https://github.com/Qualcomm-HypX-Reversing/samsung-patcher) and wait until it blinks (Apply the kernel patch)

From here, download the android NDK and run ndk-build in the **root** directory and you should have libfulcrum.a in `obj/`
